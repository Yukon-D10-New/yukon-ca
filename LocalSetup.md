# Developing locally

This document will walk you through the process of setting up the project locally.
In case the project has a particular setup, it should be documented in here.

[[_TOC_]]

## Quick start

If you already have Docksal installed, just run:

   ```
   $ fin init
   $ fin setup
   $ fin import db
   ```

You may also wish to download/import files with `fin import files`.
