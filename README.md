[[_TOC_]]

## Local environment setup

For local environment setup, please check detailed instructions [here](LocalSetup.md).

There is an entry in sites/default/settings/local.settings.php that points to the same DB container for the secondary DB for migration, named migrate. You can populate it if you have the DB dump:

```
$ fin db create migrate
$ zcat drupal7.sql.gz | fin db import --db=migrate
```

## Architecture

Layout Builder: The current standard choice for components implementation is Layout Builder, so Paragraphs should normally map to Block types, exceptions apart.


## Components

`TODO`: list components from Audit

## External Integrations

`TODO`: Document SSO solution here.

## Development workflow

Every new development should be pushed to a development branch. The advice is to keep the names short: due to Pantheon's limitation, multidev cannot use longer branch names, so in case we want to use it, we should avoid the long names.

Upon pushing to a branch, you can create a Pull Request for EW to review. Branches are pushed to Pantheon so you can also spin a Multidev environment to demonstrate before merging.
